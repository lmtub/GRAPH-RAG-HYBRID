&quot;\n&quot;

&quot; writes a range of bytes from the given offset source from multiple buffers,\n&quot;

&quot; in a batch of requests that may be merged by qemu\n&quot;

&quot;\n&quot;

&quot; Example:\n&quot;

&quot; 'multiwrite 512 1k 1k ; 4k 1k' \n&quot;

&quot;  writes 2 kB at 512 bytes and 1 kB at 4 kB into the open file\n&quot;

&quot;\n&quot;

&quot; Writes into a segment of the currently open file, using a buffer\n&quot;

&quot; filled with a set pattern (0xcdcdcdcd). The pattern byte is increased\n&quot;

&quot; by one for each request contained in the multiwrite command.\n&quot;

&quot; -P, -- use different pattern to fill file\n&quot;

&quot; -C, -- report statistics in a machine parsable format\n&quot;

&quot; -q, -- quiet mode, do not show I/O statistics\n&quot;
